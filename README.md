[abbozza-arduino](https://github.com/mbrinkmeier/abbozza-arduino) and 
[abbozza-calliope](https://github.com/mbrinkmeier/abbozza-calliope), which implement the IDEs for
the specific platforms. The latter additionally requires the installer provided by [abbozza-calliope-install](https://github.com/mbrinkmeier/abbozza-calliope-install).
